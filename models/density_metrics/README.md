# DENSITY METRICS
Documentation for 2022 Summer Internship with OSPO

## Project Goal
The summer project is an enhancement project for [Sandiego](https://github.com/sandiego-rh/sandiego) and [Explorer](https://github.com/sandiego-rh/explorer). We identify the need to measure the contributors' presence and the level of committment in each repo within an organization.

This project uses the [Orbit-Love model](https://orbitmodel.com/). We use relevant data about Github projects (PR, commit, user, and issue data) to create the following novel interpretations:

1. The activity metrics aim to identify and weigh different levels of commitments
2. The community metrics aim to detect the number of unique contributors an organization has, and further discover the contributor trend in each repository
3. The purpose of performance metrics is to apply statistical methods to segment the PR/ issue response rate of each repository within an organization

These visualizations might be used by a community architect or a community manager to more fully understand the contributor-ship trends of their projects.

[Orbit-Love Model](https://orbitmodel.com/)
The Orbit-Love Model is the measurement of the member's level of involvement in the community. The measurement of Love is based on how often the member participates - their presence- including frequency and recency, and the level of commitment - different types of activities a member is doing represent different level of commitment, ranging from passive to active, the member show through their actions.

## Metrics
### Activity (-> weight)
The activity metrics aim to discover the repository activeness percentage within an organization. The features taken into the calculation are the increment in star, watch, fork, issue, PR, open PR, closed PR, commit PR, commit, and committer. By taking the above monthly average activities and comparing them with last month to determine the increase or decrease in the attribute.

Since different features indicate different importance of contribution, the following weights are given based on the suggestions from [ORBIT MODEL](https://orbitmodel.com/activities) and domain input.

- #star increment -> weight: 0.01
- #watch increment -> weight: 0.1
- #fork increment -> weight: 0.2
- #Issue increment -> weight: 0.5
- #pull request increment -> weight: 1
- #pull request open increment -> weight: 1.2
- #pull request closed increment -> weight: 1.5
- #pull request commit increment -> weight: 1.7
- #commit increment -> weight: 1.3
- #committer increment -> weight: 1.6

The percentage of the repository activity within an org determines which repository within an organization has been contributing a positive (or negative) activity. By clicking on the repo, a breakdown graph will be generated and display the breakdown of each activity, so that community managers can have a sense of whether it is the decrease in committer that is slowing down the growth of open source projects, or it is the increase in pull requests that are driving the projects, etc.

### Communities
The community metrics aim to detect which repo in an organization is growing/ declining in the number of unique committers by month.

By clicking on the repo, a breakdown table would display the name of the committer and its affiliation followed by its location. With the number of commits by month from each committer, the community manager would be able to know whom the community is losing or how many new contributors are coming into the community, thus making impactful decisions on building a stronger community.

- Contributor
    - #committers
        - #of unique contributors
        - #of commits by committer by month

### Performances (-> weight)
The performance metrics aim to discover and segment how much time an issue/pr requires from open to close, along with consideration on how much time an issue/pr has been closed (exponential decay). The more recent an issue/pr is closed, the stronger contribution to the performance; the lesser time an issue/pr requires from open to close, indicates a better performance, thus a higher weight. 

By clicking on each repo, it generates a monthly breakdown bar chart in the bottom, which gives the community manager a better sense on how the performance goes by time, whether it is turning from a fastly response repo into a stale repo or growing in speed.


- Issue from open to close duration
    - 5 groups (fast, mild, slow, stale, expired)
        - <= 30 days -> weight: 1
        - <= 60 days -> weight: 0.66
        - <= 90 days -> weight: 0.33
        - > 90 days -> weight: 0.1
        - > 365 days -> weight: 0
Issue close within an hour will be considered as bot response -> exclude

- PR from open to close duration
    - 5 groups (fast, mild, slow, stale, expired)
        - <= 15 days -> weight: 1
        - <= 30 days -> weight: 0.66
        - <= 45 days -> weight: 0.33
        - > 60 days -> weight: 0.1
        - > 365 days -> weight: 0
PR close within an hour will be considered as bot response -> exclude

- PR/ issue close exponential decay
The more recent an issue or a PR is being closed, the stronger indication it is to the performance. Thus a higher weight it has to the metric.
    - Close within 1 mo -> weight: 1
    - Close within 2 mo -> weight: 0.9
    - Close within 3 mo -> weight: 0.9*0.9
    - etcâ€¦
    - PR/ issue been closed longer than 365 days ago is no longer considered

### Statistics
- Elbow method for clustering
- Normalization on time series data

### Visualization
[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) is an open source python framework create by plotly for creating interactive and customized web applications.

# How to run the app locally...
1. Clone this project from GitHub in your local project directory
2. Change into the project directory
3. Run `python3 -m venv <name_of_virtualenv>`
4. Run `source <name_of_virtualenv>/bin/activate` in the command line to activate the virtual environment
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies
6. Put the config.json file to the same level as index. Here is a sample of what the config.json file needs to look like:
    `
    {
        "connection_string": "sqlite:///:memory:",
        "database": "sandiegorh",
        "host": "chaoss.tv",
        "password": "<<Your Password>>",
        "port": 5432,
        "schema": "augur_data",
        "user": "<<Your Username>>",
        "user_type": "read_only"
    }
    `
7. Run `app.py`, the application should now start loading


### What can be done more with the data...
- Organizational diversity (company sponsored project)
